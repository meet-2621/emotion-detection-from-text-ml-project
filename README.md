# Emotion Detection from Text 🧠

This project predicts human emotions (joy, anger, sadness, fear, love, surprise) from text using NLP and Machine Learning.

## 📊 Project Overview
- Cleaned and preprocessed textual data
- Converted text into numerical features using TF-IDF
- Trained and compared:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
- Evaluated accuracy and visualized results with Seaborn

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset
[Kaggle – Emotion Dataset for NLP](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp)

## ⚙️ Steps to Run
1. Clone this repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-detection-from-text-ml-project.git
Open the notebook:- 🧠 Project - Emotion Detection from Text
Download and extract the dataset from Kaggle (train.txt, test.txt, val.txt)

Run all cells to train and evaluate the models.
